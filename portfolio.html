                        <h3>Facial emotion recognition using CNN</h3>
                        <p>In this project, I developed a facial emotion recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)to identify human emotions from facial expressions. The system is designed to classify images of human faces into various emotion categories such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and neutral.</p>
